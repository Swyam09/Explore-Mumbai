"Mumbai, a top-30 global tourist destination, welcomes nearly 6 million visitors annually. As of 2018, it ranked as India's second most populous city and the seventh most populous worldwide, with 19.98 million residents. Mumbai boasts a blend of cultural and natural heritage, alongside modern entertainment options, including beaches, cinemas, film studios, holy sites, amusement parks, and historic landmarks.

Sangrahalaya, Discovery of India, National Gallery of Modern Art, National Museum of Indian
Cinema, and Mani Bhavan Gandhi Sangrahalaya.[2]

Chapter 3 Requirement and Analysis
3.1 Problem Definition
Mumbai originally comprised seven islands, surrounded by the Arabian Sea on one side and the Indian subcontinent on the other. Over time, these islands were connected using sea walls and bunds, resulting in 60% of Mumbai's land being reclaimed. Today, the area from Mahim to Colaba is considered Mumbai city, while the region north of Mahim and Sion is its suburbs. It's the capital of Maharashtra and India's financial hub, driven by its history as a prominent cotton trading market and port. The city boasts numerous heritage structures, primarily in the south, which was historically the main entry point through the port.[6]
The southern tip of Mumbai is home to the Fort precinct, once enclosed by fortified walls during the colonial era. As of 2012, the city had 591 registered heritage structures, including buildings, archaeological sites, colonial, industrial, and domestic architectural sites, as well as public spaces.
Despite its rich heritage, many Mumbaikars remain unaware of their city's history and significance. Mumbai's complexity can be challenging to navigate, even for its residents. To address this issue, we are developing "Explore Mumbai," a website aimed at raising awareness about the city's cultural heritage and history, making it easily accessible to all. "Explore Mumbai" allows users to book tours within the city while providing informative facts about Mumbai. Our goal is to create a reliable source of information and booking for heritage tours with a user-friendly interface. This initiative aims to combat online fraud and boost Mumbai's tourism sector, ultimately benefiting the city's economy.[7]
